/**
 * Test harness for nxc_ui: loads the shared Lua modules into a Lua 5.4
 * engine running under WebAssembly, so pure-logic modules are testable without
 * the FiveM runtime.
 *
 * Identical in shape to nxc_lib's and nxc_core's, and identical on purpose:
 * a harness that differs per resource is a harness whose differences nobody
 * remembers.
 *
 * This is why modules must call no natives. wasmoon provides Lua, not FiveM —
 * there is no GetPlayerPed and no TriggerClientEvent. Any logic entangled with a
 * native is untestable here and belongs in a separate module.
 *
 * THE LOAD ORDER COMES FROM `fxmanifest.lua`, NOT FROM THIS FILE.
 *
 * It used to read the shared directory and sort alphabetically, which worked
 * only because the filenames carried numeric prefixes. Those prefixes are gone —
 * they are not how FiveM resources are normally written — so the manifest
 * enumerates the load order instead, and this reads it from there.
 *
 * Which means the tests exercise the same declaration the server does. Reorder
 * the manifest wrongly and the suite fails here rather than on deployment.

 *
 * ONE ENGINE PER TEST, NOT PER FILE. wasmoon 1.16.0 leaks on every `doString`,
 * and an engine stops working after roughly sixty of them: Lua starts reporting
 * `_ENV` as nil, or closing the state faults with an out-of-bounds access. This
 * is reproducible on a bare engine with no Nexus code loaded at all, so it is a
 * property of the runner rather than anything the framework does.
 *
 * Loading the shared modules already spends about half that budget, which left
 * the previous per-file engine sitting just under the limit — the suite passed
 * until one more test file was added, and then unrelated files began failing at
 * teardown. An engine per test costs about thirteen milliseconds and removes the
 * cliff entirely.
